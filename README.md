## Day 10 Data Analytics  Build Journey 

I titled today's exercise: Bringing the Sales Performance Dashboard to Life

Today was all about pulling the entire analysis together and transforming insights into a clear, compelling dashboard.

Here’s what I did:

✨ Dashboard wireframe: Laying out the structure and flow
✨ Monthly trend chart: Highlighting performance over time
✨ Supporting visuals: Building all additional charts for deeper insight
✨ Layout design: Aligning and arranging every visual for clarity
✨ Insight storytelling: Connecting the charts into a cohesive narrative

It’s exciting to see the pieces finally coming together.

Next step: Showcasing the completed dashboard in the coming days. Stay tuned!
