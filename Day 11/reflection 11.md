## Day 11

It has been a long week packed with activities of learning, relearning, and unlearning. Building a dashboard on Excel wasn’t as easy as I thought. Overall, I have learnt the art of building using Power Pivot and the camera to link facts to the dashboard, and the art of presentation. One key fact is getting the analysis done; another is putting all the pieces together for logical communication flow, which was tough. 
Finally, I was able to assemble all the pieces on the dashboard. Design is not perfect, but I am able to communicate some facts. 

Key takeaways:
TOP 5 MARKETS: 
California 21.6% ($131K), New York 11.8% ($72K), Texas 6.9% ($42K), Pennsylvania 5.4% ($33K), Michigan 4.5% ($27K).  
CONCENTRATION: 
Top 5 states account for 50.2% of total revenue, top 3 drive 40.2%. California outperforms average state by +870.4%. 
REGIONAL: 
West region dominates with 30.7% ($187K), while South lags at 15.4% ($94K). 
INSIGHT: Geographic concentration risk high. Recommend diversification into the South region and mid-tier markets to reduce dependency on top performers.

Next step: Stepping back to see what more I could have done better.
