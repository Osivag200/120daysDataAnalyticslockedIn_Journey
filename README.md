##Day 12 of my Data Analytics Build Journey 

Today is about  Self-Evaluation— to assess my learning journey so far on the completed Sales performance dashboard (guided project) from Day 11

I took time to reflect on:
🔹 What I’ve truly learned
🔹 The skills I still need to strengthen
🔹 How to apply these learnings more confidently using the tool

In the coming days, I’ll be revisiting the dataset—not as someone following a guided project, but as someone intentionally practicing to build mastery, consistency and clarity with one key goal —  GROWTH.
