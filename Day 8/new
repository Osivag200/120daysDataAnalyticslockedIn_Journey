## Day 8 of Data Analytics Build Journey 
After spending the last two days reviewing my previous week (Day 6) and planning intentionally for the new one (Day 7), I kicked off a fresh project: Sales Performance Dashboard.
Before started off, I took a step back to understand the business problem and the goal of the analysis. With that clarity, I dove into the dataset and walked through the essential foundational steps:
🔹 Structured the data into a clean, organized table
🔹 Checked for inconsistencies and carried out necessary cleaning
🔹 Built a pivot table to explore patterns and relationships
🔹 Identified the key business KPIs to focus on
🔹 Created a date table to support time intelligence
🔹 Wrote DAX measures to enable deeper insights and dynamic reporting
This groundwork is setting a solid foundation for the dashboard to deliver meaningful and actionable insights.
I am excited to keep building on this in the coming days!
