## Day 9 Data Analytics  Build Journey 

I titled today's exercise: Deepening the Sales Performance Analysis.

Building on the Sales Performance Dashboard I started yesterday, I moved into the next phase of the analysis—digging deeper to answer the core business questions identified.

Today’s focus was on uncovering patterns, performance drivers, and customer behaviour through these key analysis components:

🔹 Time Intelligence Analysis – Monthly trends, and year-over-year performance

🔹 Customer Segmentation – Understanding who is driving revenue and how their behaviour differs

🔹 Product Analysis – Identifying top-performing categories and contribution to overall sales

🔹 Geographical Insights – Comparing performance across locations and regions

These pieces are starting to form a clearer narrative of what’s happening in the business and why.

Next step: bringing everything together into an insightful, decision-ready dashboard in the coming days.
