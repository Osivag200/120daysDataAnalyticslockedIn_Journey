## Day 11

It has been a long week with parked of activities of learning, relearning and unlearning. Building dashboard on Excel wasn’t as easy as I thought. Overall, I have learnt the art of building using pivot table to build, using camera to link fact and the art of presentation. One key fact is getting the analysis done another is putting all the piece together for logical communication flow was tough. 
Finally, I was able to assemble all the piece on the dashboard. Design not perfect but able to communicate some facts. 
Key takeaways:
TOP 5 MARKETS: 
California 21.6% ($131K), New York 11.8% ($72K), Texas 6.9% ($42K), Pennsylvania 5.4% ($33K), Michigan 4.5% ($27K).  
CONCENTRATION: 
Top 5 states account for 50.2% of total revenue, top 3 drive 40.2%. California outperforms average state by +870.4%. 
REGIONAL: 
West region dominates with 30.7% ($187K), while South lags at 15.4% ($94K). 
INSIGHT: Geographic concentration risk high. Recommend diversification into South region and mid-tier markets to reduce dependency on top performers.

Next step: Stepping back to see what more I could have done better.
